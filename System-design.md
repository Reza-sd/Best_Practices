###  mistakes in system design

 Here are the biggest mistakes I see 99% of YOU making in system design interviews:

- Jumping into design without clarifying requirements

- Spending too much time on requirements analysis (and running out of time)

- Not defining the scope and priorities (and end up designing everything... badly)

- Failing to state assumptions (scale, traffic, SLA, and so on)

- Ignoring scalability and future growth (designing for 10 users instead of 1 million)

- Overlooking performance and latency

- Forgetting fault tolerance and single points of failure

- Skipping security and privacy concerns

- Treating observability as a “bonus” instead of a requirement

- Lacking a structured approach (by not doing enough mock interviews)

- Diving into details before giving a high-level overview

- Not breaking the system into modular components

- Staying surface-level without enough technical depth

- Skipping data modeling

- Choosing improper databases

- Not accounting for data growth (no sharding/partitioning)

- Misusing or ignoring caching

- Over-engineering or under-engineering the solution

- Neglecting to discuss trade-offs while giving answers

- Failing to consider alternative solutions

- Using generic BUZZWORDS without specifics

- Lacking depth in key concepts

- Not explaining your thought process (thinking silently)

- Monologuing without engaging the interviewer

- Ignoring interviewer’s feedback or hints

- Poor time management and pacing

- Getting lost in one detail (and never coming back)

- Using a one-size-fits-all template solution

- Leaving out critical architectural components

- Failing to address edge cases and extreme scenarios

- Ignoring consistency vs availability trade-off (CAP theorem)

- Skipping back-of-the-envelope calculations

- Overlooking cost implications

- Focusing on irrelevant failure modes (while ignoring core ones)

- Bluffing when you don’t know (and getting exposed instantly)

- Not validating your design against requirements

- Neglecting to use a clear diagram or visual aid

- Not summarizing your solution at the end

- Being “passive” and waiting for the interviewer to lead

- Never walking through an actual user scenario (start to finish)

- Treating the interview like a quiz instead of a collaborative discussion
